# DefendTheEarth

This is a very basic javascript game.
It looks a lot like space invaders.

The main goal is to defend the earth from the asteroids, by shooting them.
The first 4 level you pass, will upgrade your ship.
The more higher you level is, the faster will be the asteroids.

#ToDo
 - Add crates that player can shoot in order to get short period bonuses.
 - Add css
 - Add sprites
 - Add a leaderboard with a database (probably progrsql)
 - Add event that, every 1 sec, 1 point of overload goes down
 - Add event when the overload bar is full 

#Bugs
	
add Kallyo to project
